In the Edo Period, the Japanese rendition of “city” did not encompass the extensive railway networks now stretch across straits, through mountains, and beneath the ground. Osaka, for instance, relied on numerous public owned bridges for transportation. Osaka, for example, primarily relied on numerous publicly owned bridges for transportation. It wasn’t until Commodore Perry’s “gift”, more accurately, a demonstration of American power, of a miniature running steam locomotive that trains and railroads truly captured public attention.
